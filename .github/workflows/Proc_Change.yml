            Here is a checklist of items to remember when ammending procedures:

            - [ ] Procedure included in AIRAC data?

            - [ ] If removal of proc: Check all manual data is deleted (NAV > Proc)
            
            - [ ] Procedure combiner (check it actually combines)
            
            - [ ] GNG generated maps working (important if GM, BR, VA, ZV - check topsky maps!)

            - [ ] TopSky initial climb (SID)

            - [ ] Documentation? (renumbering usually donÂ´t require changes)
            Hint: Check https://wiki.vatsim-scandinavia.org/books/quick-reference/page/aerodromes-qrh
            
            - [ ] TopSky maps/manual maps?
